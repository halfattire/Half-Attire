# Authentication Persistence Fix - Testing Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Login Components
- **Login.jsx**: Updated to properly store both `token` and `userData` in localStorage on successful login
- Added explicit token storage for both Google login and regular login

### 2. Created AuthInitializer Component
- **AuthInitializer.jsx**: New component that handles authentication restoration on app startup
- Runs on client-side only to avoid SSR issues
- Validates user data structure before restoring
- Includes proper error handling and cleanup

### 3. Updated Providers
- **providers.jsx**: Integrated AuthInitializer to wrap all children
- Removed conflicting authentication initialization code
- Simplified to focus on app data loading

### 4. Axios Interceptors
- **axios-interceptors.js**: New service that automatically adds tokens to all requests
- Handles 401 responses by clearing auth data and redirecting to login
- Initialized in app layout to ensure it runs on every page

### 5. Enhanced Auth Persistence Service
- **auth-persistence.js**: Improved error handling and validation
- Better token management
- Consistent localStorage operations

## How It Works

1. **On Login**: Both `token` and `userData` are stored in localStorage
2. **On App Start**: AuthInitializer checks localStorage and restores auth state
3. **On Requests**: Axios interceptor automatically adds token to headers
4. **On Auth Errors**: 401 responses trigger automatic logout and redirect

## Testing Instructions

### Development Testing
1. Login to your account
2. Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
3. Verify both `token` and `userData` are present
4. Refresh the page - you should remain logged in
5. Check console for "Restoring authentication from localStorage" message

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to your production environment
2. Login and test page refresh
3. Close browser completely and reopen
4. Navigate directly to protected routes
5. Check browser console for any authentication-related errors

### Debugging
If authentication still doesn't persist:

1. **Check localStorage**: Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Should see `token` and `userData` keys
   - `userData` should be valid JSON with `_id` and `email`

2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for:
   - "Restoring authentication from localStorage"
   - Any error messages from AuthInitializer

3. **Check Network Tab**: 
   - API requests should include `Authorization: Bearer [token]` header
   - No 401 responses on page load

4. **Check Redux DevTools**: 
   - User state should be populated after page refresh
   - `isAuthenticated` should be `true`

## Environment Considerations

### Production vs Development
- Development: Uses `http://localhost:3000`
- Production: Uses your production domain
- Ensure cookies and localStorage work correctly on your production domain

### HTTPS Requirements
- Production should use HTTPS for secure cookie handling
- Mixed content (HTTP/HTTPS) can cause auth issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Cookies disabled**: Application relies on localStorage, not cookies
2. **Private browsing**: localStorage may not persist
3. **Domain changes**: Auth data is domain-specific
4. **CORS issues**: Ensure backend allows credentials

### Reset Authentication
If you need to reset authentication state:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('token');
localStorage.removeItem('userData');
location.reload();
```

## Backend Requirements

Ensure your backend:
1. Returns `token` field in login responses
2. Accepts `Authorization: Bearer [token]` headers
3. Returns proper 401 status for invalid tokens
4. Supports CORS with credentials for your domain

The authentication should now persist correctly across page refreshes and browser sessions in both development and production environments.
