# Production Authentication Fix Guide

## Problem
Users are getting logged out on page reload/route changes in production.

## Root Causes Fixed
1. **Redux Persist Configuration**: Improved persistence with timeout and whitelisting
2. **Authentication State Restoration**: Better handling of persisted auth state
3. **Storage Synchronization**: Unified localStorage and cookie management
4. **Race Conditions**: Added initialization states to prevent premature redirects

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Persistence Service (`lib/auth-persistence.js`)
- Centralized authentication data management
- Validates user data structure before loading
- Handles storage errors gracefully
- Provides consistent API for auth operations

### 2. Redux Store Configuration (`redux/store.js`)
- Added `whitelist` to only persist essential reducers
- Added `timeout` for rehydration in slow networks
- Better SSR handling

### 3. Protected Route Component (`components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
- Added initialization state to prevent premature redirects
- Improved authentication restoration logic
- Added delays to prevent race conditions
- Better error handling for corrupted data

### 4. Providers Component (`app/providers.jsx`)
- Initialize authentication before loading other data
- Use persistence service for reliable auth restoration
- Handle both local and server-side authentication

### 5. User Actions (`redux/actions/user.js`)
- Use persistence service for storing user data
- Better error handling for authentication failures
- Consistent storage management

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all production URLs are correct in `.env.production`
2. **Cookie Settings**: Ensure cookies work with your domain (SameSite, Secure flags)
3. **Backend CORS**: Ensure backend allows credentials from production domain
4. **Session Persistence**: Backend should maintain sessions properly

## Testing
1. Login to the application
2. Reload the page - should stay logged in
3. Navigate between routes - should stay logged in
4. Close browser and reopen - should stay logged in (if token valid)
5. Clear localStorage - should redirect to login

## Monitoring
Monitor for these issues in production:
- Authentication restoration failures
- Excessive login redirects
- Storage errors in console
- Cookie/localStorage inconsistencies
